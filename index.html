    <h1>My Imaginary Pet</h1>
    <br>
    <p>He hates going for long walks but doesn't mind a long flight or two. He's got a <i>bit</i> of a tmeper and only responds to "dracaris".
    Still haven't gotten him fire trained yet and was disappointed to find he burned a young boy while going for his morining hunt.
    Had to be strict with hime and sent him to the dungeon but that only made things worse. He stopped growing and became quite a handful
    for the feeders. I'm still deciding whether or not to let him and his sibling out but I think I'll wait for their older brother to get
    back before I make my choice.</p>
